> The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old but on building the new.

# Leaving Shore

Picture yourself on a creaky wooden boat. Listen to the boards strain against the water as the ocean rocks it back and forth. The boat is drifting along, and soon you find yourself alone. There is at once both a profound sense of peace in the isolation of the waves as well as a building fear: "_Will I ever make it home?_"

Home can be whatever you need it to be: A family, a job, a girl or boyfriend, a sense of meaning. It's that aching longing in the back of your mind. That's part of being human. We all have that longing to make ourselves whole again. 

And, naturally, part of life is being broken. The challenge, and joy, comes with being adrift.

I'm starting to feel this now as my current job nears its last six months. The job was a rock of stability for me. It gave me financial security, sure, but it also provided me with a sense of belonging. When leaving or losing a job it's easy to feel askew. And for a while I've been drifting.

But, it's important not to drift for too long. The tides are fickle. Some may lead to warmer waters, but, like fate, I don't believe in leaving destiny in another's hands.

## When you're drifting, the most important thing to do is _row_.

To row is to move in the direction you choose. If you've been drifting for a while it might seem unnatural. The resistance of the oar strains against atrophied shoulder and back. It's the chafing after running again after a long break, or the wake up call your muscles give you after a hard workout. Your body signals you to stop. 

And that's the insidious voice inside your head. STOP. Learn to love being drift. 

I used to believe this. I took "be like water" as a truism. Doesn't adaptability mean enjoying riding the tide? But, when Bruce Lee spoke of _being like water _I think he was implying something different.

Being in flow means flexibility while in motion. Going with the flow means to keep striving even while amongst the waves.

_It means you have to keep rowing.  _

Finding what you want in life is kind of like searching for land while in the sea. You'll still get there without rowing- nowadays death isn't usually what stops you from getting what you want. It's the parasitic nature of comfort. You'll find an island without rowing. If you stay in the boat long enough something will appear. And, if you have never taken up the row, it is easy to see that as fate. This is where I was meant to be.

And that's the difference between the drifter and the rower. The rower hasn't been drifting. He's been rowing. Sometimes in circles, other times for miles against the current, even though he is unsure of where it might lead. Sometimes he sees debris in the water and imagines it a sign of good fortune ahead. over times he tries to interpret the stars. But, he keeps moving forward, striking out into the abyss with the gifts of his arms and back. 

And when he sees an island in the distance, he sees in not as fate, but as chance. And will happily wade out into the water again if that chance does not strike at the core of his identity. 

And that is the main difference between the drifter and the rower. **Life is in the rowing. **

And I think its easy to forget that. We spend our days looking at streams of images of our friends happily enjoying their lives, with now concept of the energy or commitment it took for them to reach where they are. Everyone has fought against their own set of waves. And it's easy to forgot that the struggle is real, at least for any conclusion worth fighting for. 

So, this is my call to arms. To stop spending my days looking for islands in the distance and instead to start rowing. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/47631d82-59e3-42c4-84e5-576404298ae1.JPG)

Just picture the world as a archipelago. There are islands of every conceivable shape and size. Some are beautiful and green. Others are shallow crags of jutting rock. Some people spend their entire lives on one island. Others drift for years, bouncing from one temporary respite to the next. I've been happily living on an island in southern Japan for about three years. And soon I'm deliberately setting myself adrift. 

Why? Because life is in the rowing. 

Brian Cranston has a great [philosophy on acting][0]. His advice to new actors is to not think of auditioning as an attempt to get a job. Auditioning is a chance for him to create a character that does justice to the script and to perform that for an audience (those casting). Getting the job is completely out of his control. All he can do is _act. _All the rower can do is grab the oar and get back to work.

So, whatever you feel your life's work to be, no matter how important or trivial, get out there and start the process. _Contribute_. For it is through that bold push into the unknown that we find the vistas we've all been searching for.
