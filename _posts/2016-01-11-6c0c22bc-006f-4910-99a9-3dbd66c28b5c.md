# How to Write

## Excerpt from_Confessions of an Advertising Man _by David Ogilvy:

The better you write, the higher you will go in Ogilvy & Mather.

_People who think well, write well._

Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well.

Here are 10 Hints:

* Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three times.
* Write the way you talk. Naturally.
* Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.
* Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgementally. They are all hallmarks of a pretentious ass.
* Never write more than two pages on any subject.
* Check your quotations.
* Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it.
* Read it aloud the next morning- and then edit it.
* If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.
* Before you send your letter or memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.
* If you want ACTION, don't write. Go and tell the guy what you want.
