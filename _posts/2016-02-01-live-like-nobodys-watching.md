# Live like nobody's watching.

## Write like nobody's reading. Produce like nobody's viewing. Create like no body cares.

Because, really, where would a boat take you if every time someone else offered an opinion you changed course?  You'd likely zigzag at best; meander in a circle at worst. 

Because that's what you do every time you stop writing, stop making, creating, imagining, singing, acting, being... just because of that latent fear that someone will care. Or, that no one will.

Both are terrifying. If someone takes an interest in my work, what does that say about me? Art is raw. It's silly, provocative, dirty, childish, real. It's littered with mistakes. It's produced without budget, but with heart. 

If no one takes an interest in my work.. What was the point? Why even create? It doesn't help me buy lunch. 

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER _IS_.. nobody cares.  Or, a better way to put that is.. The only people who care enjoy you for who you are already. Any self expression is just an addition to that core.

Anyone who takes offense... If they confront you and take the time to explain then it's a learning experience. If not, then they didn't really care. There are a lot of critics out there. 

They're not what matters. What matters is you facing the world boldly and saying, "This is me. This is my writing. This is my passion. There are so many things I haven't done."**Just you wait. **
