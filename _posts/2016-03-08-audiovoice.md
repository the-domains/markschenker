# Narration

I've been editing and producing narration projects as a side business for the last 2 years. My audiobook work includes work for private clients as well as sites like [Audible.com][0].

Here's an example of a [short story][1] and [commercial demo][2]. 

This has been a great creative outlet for me and I look forward to narrating more books and short stories in the future. Since high school I've never gone more than 2 or 3 years without being a part of a musical or play. With audio work I love being able to have complete control over a character and to be able to fully deliver a performance with my voice.

If you would like to know more about my past acting experience, here is a list of [past performances][3] I have been a part of.
