# Narration

I've been editing and producing narration projects as a side business for the last 2 years. My audiobook work includes work for private clients as well as sites like [Audible.com][0].

Here's an example of a [short story][1] and [commercial demo][2]. 

This has been a great creative outlet for me and I look forward to narrating more books and short stories in the future.
