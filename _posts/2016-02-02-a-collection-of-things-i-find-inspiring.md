# My Inspiration Box

[This blog][0] is another subdomain of mine. It's simply a collection of things I've found on the interwebs that struck a chord with me. This is a bit of an eclectic mix: everything from pictures of cats to TED videos to quotes. You get the drift. Might be worth a look if you need to kill a little time in your work day (don't worry, I won't tell your boss).
