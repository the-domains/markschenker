## A part of me will always be stuck in Japan.

<article style=""><h1>Lessons on Japan and Japanese life</h1><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6502ca9b7a8e742c84d3068c3cc2997c6665388e.png" /></article>

Between 2013 and 2016 I spent three years living and teaching English in Kochi City, Japan. I worked a several middle schools and elementary schools. My job was to offer support during class and assist in grading. 

But, as it is with any life abroad experience, those three years were much more than that. They were a mix of wonder and fear, discovery and loss. It was the first time I can remember feeling completely off the grid. 

It was also a chance to learn a language and culture completely different from the one I knew. Both Japanese and Japan can be incredibly simple and complex at the same time. 

Luckily I took lots of pictures, and have a ton of memories, which I will slowly be adding to [this blog][0] as I continue learning Japanese and reflecting on what my Japan experience meant. 

If you're curious about what life in Japan is like, or about Japanese study, I hope this can help you. It's an amazing country. Three years and I still haven't seen anything yet. 

_Don't worry Japan, I'll be back._
